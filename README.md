## Dataset and preprocesing
- We have used "ABC notation" for dataset. You can find ABC notation data [here](https://abc.sourceforge.net/NMD/).


## Naive Bayes
- Setup environment `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- To run code `python Naive_Final.py`
- Directory `tschai` contains the sample input(train dataset)

## LSTM
- Upload the given `LSTM.ipynb` to notebook.
- `all_song_abc.txt` contains training dataset required to execute the ipynb notebook.

## Vanilla NN
- Upload the given `Vanilla_NN.ipynb` to notebook.
- `data.txt` contains training dataset required to execute the ipynb notebook.

## Markov Chain
- Upload the given `markov_hains.ipynb` to notebook.
- `data.txt` contains training dataset required to execute the ipynb notebook.
